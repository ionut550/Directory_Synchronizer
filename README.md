# Directory_Synchronizer
This project is meant to synchronize 2 directories in only one direction from source to replica. Any changes in the source folder will be translated to the replica folder, even file changes.
You must specify set the absolute path of the source, replica and log file.
The code behind the project is error proof, and don't let you introduce a wrong path, a file path instead of a directory and you can't introduce by mistake the same path to both source and replica.
If you don't want to run the code in the IDE inside the dist directory you have an .exe of this program with the same functionality.
I would appreciate any kind of feedback on ilie.ionut@yahoo.com
Thank you.
